# WEB DEV Jorney


This repository contains my journey in web development, where I aim to maintain a streak of consistent learning and improvement. The project showcases my skills in HTML and CSS, with a focus on implementing various elements and styling properties.

## How the story going!!
   i think readme.md as a notebook in which i can write whatever way i want to express this journey..
   actually i am not if learning web development is valid or not... for one who starts with the basics like HTML ,css today many people just say to learn AI directly.. But i believe that even if I know how to train models, how tunning works, how to get data from the web, all of this knowledge will be wasted if i dont even know how the INTERNET works. Thats the reason i started learning development.. I dont know if iam on a right path or not! but as soon as i am learning something new everyday. It makes sense to me :-)
